    <p>Hello, World!</p>
    <!-- Second paragraph describing something you did today -->
    <p>The Avengers are a team of extraordinary heroes assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect the world from threats too big for any one hero to handle alone. Comprised of powerful individuals like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, the Avengers unite their unique strengths to battle formidable enemies, from alien invasions to rogue A.I. and intergalactic tyrants like Thanos. Their diverse abilities and unwavering dedication to justice make them Earth's mightiest heroes, a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Together, they prove that no challenge is too great when heroes join forces for a common cause.</p>
